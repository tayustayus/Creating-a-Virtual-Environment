# Creating-a-Virtual-Environment
It was an uphill task for me to get aound this subject. I got a piece that expalins but terminal wasn't installing keras and tensorflow or better put, it installs but returns with eror. Another version installs fine but venv doesnt appeaer on anaconda. I was able to marry two together and solved a problem. This is to save you from the stress.
